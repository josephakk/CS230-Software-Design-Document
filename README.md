# CS230-Software-Design-Document
Software design document for "Draw It or Lose It" game for The Gaming Room. 

The Gaming Room was looking to develop a web-based version of their Android exclusive game, "Draw It or Lose It." 
The game is a multiplayer drawing and guessing game with a similar concept to the game Win, Lose, or Draw. 
The goal of the project was to create a web-based verson of the game so that it could be played across multiple
platforms. Some of the required features for the web-based application included: user authentication, real-time communication,
and quick image rendering. 

I think what I did well was making my answers both concise and in depth. I tried to write my design document in a non-technical way
so taht it would be easy for both the developers and stakeholders to understand. The document outlined the application's key components,
how they interact, and a general overview of the entire project. 
If I could revise one thing about my document, I think I would go a little further and provide even more detailed use cases.

The design document acted as a roadmap during development, and was especially helpful during Project 1. Having a design document
helped me to maintain a sense of direction, and made sure that I was hitting all of the key system requirements. 

The user needs were very simple for this project, and easy to identify. The client currently has a game apllication that runs
only on Android devices, and wanted to expand the application to be able to work on all platforms. I made suggestions about
possible operation system choices as well as security features that I believe will be the best fit. 

For future application design, I would consider using a more agile, iteration-based development cycle. As well as meeting
with end-users and stakeholders to determine the exact application requirements.
